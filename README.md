### Overview 

FrostFire is a top-down multiplayer survival game that enforces cooperation in the context of horde-mode style gameplay.

The goal is to survive the onslaught of enraged snowmen while keeping your only source of heat, the campfire, alive. 
Alongside defending the fire from the snowmen, players must also collect logs around the map to replenish its constantly diminishing fuel. 
If the campfire's fuel runs out, the players lose. If the campfire's still alive and the players clear all the waves of snowmen, the players win.
